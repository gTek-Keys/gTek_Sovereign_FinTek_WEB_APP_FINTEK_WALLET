FADE IN:

EXT. THE BLOCK - NIGHT
Streetlights buzz under a constellation-coded sky. This isn‚Äôt just any neighborhood. It‚Äôs THE BLOCK. Where dreams don‚Äôt die ‚Äî they compound.

                    JIN KAIRO (V.O.)
      We didn‚Äôt grow up together, but we grew into each other.
      Four brothers. One pulse. One block.

FLASH CUTS:
- RICO BLAZE training with neon gauntlets in a sacred gym
- ZION LUXX electrifying a rooftop party like a frequency sorcerer
- NITRO ZEEK‚Äôs car leaving light trails like constellations
- NIA MOON decrypting a ritual scroll using holo-lens

EXT. LIQUOR STORE ‚Äî NIGHT
The shop stands silent. Faint echoes of OG MARZ‚Äôs voice echo through the alley...

                    JIN KAIRO (V.O.)
      Some say OG Marz disappeared years ago... but his spirit never left the block.

INT. BASEMENT TEMPLE ‚Äî NIGHT
The four brothers sit around a quantum firepit. No one notices‚Äîbut a shadow of OG MARZ flickers in the wall flames.

                    NIA MOON
      They call it culture, but we call it truth.

                    ZION LUXX
      This ain‚Äôt just about art. It‚Äôs activation.

                    JIN KAIRO
      Make the industry ‚Äî don‚Äôt let the industry make you.

                    OG MARZ (V.O.)
      They‚Äôll forget your name, but they won‚Äôt forget your frequency.

EXT. BLOCK PARTY TEMPLE - NIGHT
The BLOCK comes alive. Every corner amplifies a dream. A holographic banner reads: **MAKE THE INDUSTRY**.

                    CROWD (CHANTING)
      MAKE. THE. INDUSTRY.

                    JIN KAIRO (V.O.)
      We made something where they left nothing. We called it home.

SUPER: ‚ÄúMake The Industry. Don‚Äôt Let The Industry Make You.‚Äù

- Codex film writers
- NFT screenplay minting
- Decentralized cinematic IP governance

## Theme
**MAKE THE INDUSTRY. DON‚ÄôT LET THE INDUSTRY MAKE YOU.**
Four friends become chosen brothers on a sacred block, each chasing their dreams while building a cultural tech stronghold. OG MARZ is the cryptic and omniscient spirit voice of JIN KAIRO ‚Äî guiding the narrative like a hooded mythkeeper.

## Features
- gTek OmniLicense protection
- ERC-721 NFT deploy-ready smart contract
- .gitignore hardened for film coding
- Ready for IPFS / Arbitrum integration

## Minting
Use the `MakeTheIndustryNFT` contract to tokenize your screenplay, assign metadata to `tokenURI`, and track provenance.
