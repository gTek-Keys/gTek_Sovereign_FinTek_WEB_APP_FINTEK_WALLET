IEEE Project Authorization Request (PAR) — Draft

-----------------------------------------
Project Title:
IEEE Standard for Sovereign Faith-State Logic and Quantum Resonance Processing Systems (gNaRa gNeN4™)

Working Group Chair:
Jerome Hill (Tok Commander)
Email: gtek@gtekglobal.design
Affiliation: gTek Sovereign Systems | MetAHueman TrustChain Labs
ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0001-7636-2345

-----------------------------------------
1. Project Scope:
This standard specifies the architectural requirements, symbolic logic protocols, material substrates, and programmable harmonic gate systems required to implement the gNaRa gNeN4™ processor. The standard defines FaithGate structures, Harmony Logic Functions, CIDEX NFT registry protocol, and secure hardware-to-ledger interfaces using sovereign trust-state logic.

2. Purpose:
The purpose of this standard is to establish a secure, culturally aligned, and ethically sovereign quantum computing framework. gNaRa gNeN4™ enables logic systems based on metaphysical state, divine principles, and frequency control, introducing a paradigm of purpose-driven computation rooted in ancestral epistemology.

3. Need for the Project:
Current semiconductor and AI processor standards ignore ethical alignment, cultural sovereignty, and frequency-based harmonics. There is an urgent need to formalize computation grounded in indigenous logic, sovereign authorship, and spiritually coherent hardware. This standard addresses emerging markets in sovereign AI, NFT-authorship systems, ethical quantum substrates, and decentralized identity.

4. Stakeholders:
• Indigenous technology incubators
• Blockchain developers
• Quantum computing researchers
• Narrative engine designers
• AfroAsiatic sovereign technology institutions
• Academic and spiritual hardware communities

5. Intellectual Property Clauses:
All technical contributions follow the gTek Sovereign Codex License v3.0. Any implementation must include reference to CIDEX licensing and/or author engagement via DAO protocols.

6. Potential for Global Impact:
This standard will position the IEEE at the forefront of ethically conscious computation while enabling global interoperability with sovereign systems, DAO-licensed platforms, and AfroAsiatic innovation infrastructures.
