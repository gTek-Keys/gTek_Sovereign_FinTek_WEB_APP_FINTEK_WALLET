# gNaRa gNeN⁴: A Quantum-Semiconductor & Cultural Compute Framework

**Abstract:**  
This paper introduces a sovereign processing system that fuses quantum harmonic logic with AfroAsiatic metaphysics. The architecture defines new FaithGate structures for ethical computation, anchored in ancestral philosophy and protected via CIDEX DAO licensing. gNaRa gNeN⁴ is engineered for sacred processing, narrative-driven AI, and sovereign multimedia systems.
